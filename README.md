# New Frontend for FridgiGo App without Typescript Components
Frontend for FridgiGo Application 
created with vue.js and ionic Framework without Typescript but just with Javascript

Until now the app just contains the keycloak instance, opening a login page when 
the app is opened. It does not have any content pages though.


[Here](https://ionicframework.com/docs/vue/quickstart#build-your-way-with-typescript-or-javascript) is the link to the 
manual from ionic on how to remove typescript from the ionic framework.

# Project setup

There are different components that will need to be installed on our computer in order
to run the application properly. 

+ Keycloak
+ Google API Key fror Geolocation 

## Installing Keycloak

Download Keycloak

First step is to download and extract
[keycloak-16.1.0.zip](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/download/16.1.0/keycloak-16.1.0.zip)
from the Keycloak website.

After extracting you should have a directory named keycloak-16.1.0.

## Start keycloak

From a terminal open the directory keycloak-16.1.0, then to start Keycloak run the following command.

On Linux run:
```
bin/standalone.sh
```

On Windows run:
```
bin\standalone.bat
```

## Create an admin user

Keycloak does not come with a default admin user, which means before you can start using Keycloak you need to create an admin user.

To do this open <http://localhost:8080/auth>, then fill in the form with your preferred username and password.

## Login to the admin console
Go to the Keycloak Admin Console and login with the username and password you created earlier.
Found under <http://localhost:8080>

## Create a realm

Realms are like tenants in Keycloak. The main one is called Master and should remain as it is.
So you need to crete a new realm for this application:

1. Hover your mouse over the dropdown in the top-left corner where it says ```Master```
   then click on ```Add Realm```
2. Fill in the form with the following values:
    * Name: ```myrealm``` (choose your preferred realm name)
3. Click ```Create```


## Create a user

There is no user in the realm you just created, so you need to create one:
1. Click ```Users``` in the left-hand menu
    * Click ```Add user``` in the top-right corner of the table
2. Fill in the form with the following values
    * Username: ````yourPreferredName````
    * First Name: your first name
    * Last Name: your last name
3. Click ```Save```

The user needs an initial password to log into the application. To create one do this:

1. Click ```Credentials``` on the top of the page
2. Fill in the ```Set Password``` form with a password of your choice
3. Click ```ON``` next to ```Temporary``` to prevent having to update
   the password on the first login. The button must then turn grey and show ```OFF```.

## Secure the app
